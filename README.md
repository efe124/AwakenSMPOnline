This plugin adds an AwakenSMP system with advanced features! for those don't know what Awaken SMP is: When you get killed by a player, you drop your head and can't respawn unless someone places that head to ground.

If you find any bugs, report to [my discord server](https://discord.gg/8PPgcmYNf4)! I always make my dms open and let you ping me on the server.
