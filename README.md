# AwakenSMPOnline
AwakenSMP System with advanced features


This plugin adds a revive system like in the AwakenSMP to server. If player1 was slain by someone, he drops his head and switches to spectator mode. If player2 places player1's head to ground, player1 respawns at where the head is placed. If player1's head is burned or something else, player2 can rename another player head on anvil and use it to revive player1. don't forget to give a review/rating and enjoy!

It's really simple plugin, so it can have tons of bugs. If you see a bug in the plugin, join to [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/CprAJBVve7). You can also suggest whatever you want.
